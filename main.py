# Basic idea
# On startup: need to find PoE if not fullscreen
# Run basic tests to make sure configuration is correct (inventory, trade and stash windows are where the should be)
# fetch trade data (from TFT, ninja, trade?)
# check current listing data vs fetched data and update accordingly
# monitor client file for incoming whispers and accept trades that match current listings
